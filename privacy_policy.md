# Privacy Policy for Valuation Toolkit

**Last updated: January 27, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Valuation Toolkit ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information Collection

We do not collect personal data directly. However, the App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Third-Party Services
*   **Google Firebase Authentication**: We use Firebase to authenticate users. This service may collect your email address or Apple ID identifier solely for the purpose of managing your account and securing your data.
*   **Google Gemini API**: We use Google's Gemini API to provide AI-powered analysis of financial charts. When you upload an image for analysis, that image is sent to Google's servers for processing and is not stored by us.
*   **Yahoo Finance API**: We use Yahoo Finance to fetch stock market data. Your search queries (stock symbols) are sent to this service to retrieve data.

## 2. How We Use Information

*   **Authentication**: To verify your identity and allow you to save your preferences or portfolios securely.
*   **Service Provision**: To provide the core features of the app (e.g., stock analysis, data retrieval).
*   **Improvements**: We may use aggregated, anonymized data (like crash reports via Apple) to improve the stability of the App.

## 3. Data Retention

We do not store your personal data on our own servers. Authentication data is managed by Google Firebase. You can delete your account at any time within the app (if applicable) or by contacting us, which will remove your credentials from the authentication provider.

## 4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
